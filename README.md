I'll help you create a full-stack solution for community challenges. Here's the plan:

1. **Frontend**: React-based web app with:
   - Challenge listing
   - Submission forms
   - Voting system
   - User profiles

2. **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with:
   - User authentication
   - Challenge management
   - Submission handling
   - Voting system

3. **Database**: MongoDB for storing:
   - User data
   - Challenges
   - Submissions
   - Votes

Let's start by setting up the project structure. First, we'll create the React frontend:

```bash
npx create-react-app community-challenges
```

Then we'll set up the backend:

```bash
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors
```
